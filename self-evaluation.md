# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
*I feel fairly confident with the fluency. The process is starting to make sense :) Which is very exciting

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
*I was so behind that I am grateful it was not unproductive. I did have to google a couple things as a reminder, but I think I am finally getting it!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*Just practice practice practice my technical vocabulary and language. I might know how to work my way through but still struggle to remember the right words (which will be exceedingly important for my final evaluation and communicating in the tech world moving forward). I have practice sessions set up with our small group and my partner for the evaluation over the weekend.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*Cydnee showed us some shortcut ways to write code today (that I have not used yet) which were WAY more efficient. But it was new info, so now I need to learn how to apply those shortcuts to the long way I have been utilizing. Google will be my friend. :)
